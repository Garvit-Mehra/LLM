# Custom Chatbot
- Note: Backend uses OpenAI models, the required model can be selected within the file

## Setting up
Create a ```.env``` file where you store your OpenAI api key as ```OPENAI_API_KEY```

## Running
In your commmand line interface run ```python
git clone https://github.com/Garvit-Mehra/LLM
cd LLM
pip install -r Requirements.txt
streamlit run Chatbot.py```

## Future Plans
I'm planning to add image capaclities, where the chatbot will understand images and can answer question about them
